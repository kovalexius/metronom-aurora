# metronome

A simple metronome app for the Jolla / Sailfish OS.

## TODO

* wait for Jolla to get their stuff together...
* use libaudioresource to acquire audio permissions
* what's a good way to play back low-latency audio while respecting
  volume settings etc.? Use SDL2? :P
* draw some nice visualization of the click
